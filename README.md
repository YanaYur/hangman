# **HANGMAN**
Hangman is a simple word guessing game with very simple rules.
Players try to figure out an unknown word by guessing letters. If too many letters which do not appear in the word are guessed, the player is hanged (and loses).
You will have five "chances" to guess the word, otherwise you lose.
